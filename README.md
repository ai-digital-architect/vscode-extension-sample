### üîß Automatic Code Transformation and Error Fixing

Modernization isn‚Äôt complete until your application builds successfully.

### üõ°Ô∏è Post-Upgrade CVE Validation

After the upgrade process is completed, the tool scans for CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) issues and code inconsistencies. When such issues are detected, it automatically applies fixes within VS Code Agent Mode, allowing the user to review the changes. This enhances the application's security posture and ensures compliance with organizational guidelines.
